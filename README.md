Wander is a tool for writing non-deterministic fantasy "stories". The product is a story whose unfolding is affected by decisions made by the "reader".

The author is [Peter Langston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Langston), who when asked if this is really from 1974 says:

"As I remember I came up with the idea for Wander and wrote an early version in HP Basic while I was still teaching at the Evergreen State College in Olympia, WA (that system limited names to six letters, so: WANDER, EMPIRE, CONVOY, SDRECK, GALAXY, etc.). Then I rewrote Wander in C on Harvard's Unix V5 system shortly after our band moved to Boston in 1974. I got around to putting a copyright notice on it in 1978."[1]
